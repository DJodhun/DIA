# Designing Intelligent Agents

This project compared the performance of the Genetic Algorithm to the A* Search Algorithm when trying to maximise the dirt collected by an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner. This was tested across three different environments, or maps: a clear room, a living room and a bedroom. The robot is considered to be an intelligent agent, capable of moving forwards, backwards, left and right, as well as turning 360 degrees. The dimensions are 60 Ã— 60 square body, with 2 sensors and 2 wheels, operating a differential drive system.

Experiment design:
  -Running 30 generations on the Genetic Algorithm, and 400 runs for the A* Search Algorithm, per map.
  -Gather statistics, in particular the average dirt collected per map per algorithm. 
  -Perform statistical analysis.
  -Find significant results.

The results from this project showed that the Genetic Algorithm was superior to the A* Search Algorithm in all cases, having a higher average amount of dirt collected, using a t-test at the 5% significance level. Additionally, this was achieved in a faster run time. The results folder contains the boxplots illustrating the final results.
